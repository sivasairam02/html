		<h1> First Member of the straw shats</h1>
		He first appeared in the third chapter of the One Piece manga, published in the manga magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump in 1997. Zoro is the first crewmate to join the Straw Hat Pirates, a crew of pirates captained by Monkey D. Luffy, after he is rescued by Luffy from execution. Zoro is a highly skilled swordsman and serves as one of the crew's main combatants, though he possesses an extremely poor sense of direction which recurs as a running gag throughout the series. In most voiced appearances, Zoro is voiced by actor Kazuya Nakai.
